    "*Well, here is a short milestone report for my capstone project \"Used cars database\" which includes:*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Define the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) I want to predict the price of used car based on the different listed features of the car and current market price.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) I also want to derive the top features on car which is on high demand and sold more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Identify your client:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our client is Ebay Kleinanzeigen. With difficult economic conditions, it is likely that sales of second-hand imported (reconditioned) cars and used cars will increase.It will be helpful for customers to get a correct pricing based on more features. They will get more knowledge about the new better pricing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Describe your data set, and how you cleaned/wrangled it:\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset has over 370000 used cars scraped with Scrapy from Ebay-Kleinanzeigen. It consists of 20 columns/features which include: dateCrawled, name, seller, offerType, price, abtest, vehicleType, yearOfRegistration, gearbox, powerPS, model, kilometer, monthOfRegistration, fuelType, brand, notRepairedDamage, dateCreated, nrOfPictures, postalCode, lastSeenOnline and \n",
    "are of ( int and object ) data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use the data present in the link:- https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps involved in Cleaning/Wrangling data using Pandas and Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step1:** *Importing required python packages and reading CSV file*\n",
    "\n",
    "I pulled the dataset from the different source path and read the CSV file by importing python packages. I showed initially first five rows of the dataset in a data frame **'df1'** in order to get an idea what to expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step2:** *Checking the data types/shaping/describing*\n",
    "\n",
    "I also have to consider what type of values each of our columns are stored as. We might see in some cases that numbers are imported as text strings making it impossible to perform calculations on them. To check this I used .info(). This returns a list with the data types in it - the most common types for this datset is int and object which is an alias for a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I wanted to know how many columns and rows are in our dataset and for this I used .shape command.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also wanted to see some key stats in my data frame without delving too deep, mean values, min, and max so that we can get a feel for what we're working with. To do that I used .describe().\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step3:** *Checking the missing values*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to see whether the dataset had any of the missing values, I verified by using .isnull() method and chained it with .sum() method to get the total count of the missing value for each column in the data frame. I found missing values for the columns *vechileType, gearbox, model, fuelType, notRepairedDamaged* which were all categorical type.\n",
    "\n",
    "I filled all the NaN values by introducing a new category called **'not-available'** for all these columns and checked again for anymore missing values to be fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were no more missing values and the dataset was ready for further analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Explain your initial findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the initial findings on the dataset include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** **Exploratory Data Analysis on some fields of the 'Used Car Database'**\n",
    "\n",
    "*seller:* This column has 2 unique values and “gewerblich” value has only 3 records. This column has no distinguishing information for the model. So, this column can be dropped as it may not be an influencing feature for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "*offerType:* This column has 2 unique values and “gesuch” value has only 12 records which is insignificant when we think of this feature impacting the price of the car. So, this column can be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "*monthOfRegistration:* This column should have 12 unique values. However, based on bar graph shown earlier it has 13 unique values which is not correct. Also, dataset has yearOfRegistration column. So, this column can be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "*nrOfPictures:* This column has only one value and it has no meaning for model and visualization. This column can be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "*abtest:* This column has two values 'test' and 'control' which does not give any more information on how this feature is related to used car or pricing. It has no relevance for the analysis and can be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "*dateCreated:* This column has 114 unique values and has no distinguishing information for the model. So, this column can be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** **What is the average price of the car based on vehicleType ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The table showed the average price of each vehicle type among which 'andere' vehicle type having (720695.18 Euro) was a bit costlier than others ( bus, cabrio, coupe, kleinwagen, kombi, limousine, suv ).\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** **Can we find out the min, max and average price of the car of different brands ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We see from the analysis that car prices vary from 1 to 99999999 and has varied average price. Prices as low as 1 and as high as 999999999 does not define well for the model. It needs to be cleaned further and filtered for better price range data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** **How many cars are having invalid registration year ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The table showed the count of 113 cars which don't have proper valid registration year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**e)** **Which is the most popular brand among used car in the market ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the visualization done earlier, this column has 40 different brands having consistent records which can be useful for the model. Volkswagen is the most popular one and BMW is the next popular brand to be considered among all.\n",
    "\n",
    "**f)** **What is the average price of Volkswagen ? How many cars of 'Volkswagen' brand are on sale ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Volkswagen cars on sale is: 77039 and the mean price is 15024 Euros.\n",
    "\n",
    "**g)** **Which is the most running model in Volkswagen ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the graph of 'MODELS DISTRIBUTION FOR VOLKSWAGEN BRAND' done earlier, I see that golf is the most popular and running model in Volkswagen. Next, I can see is polo which the second competitor model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**h)** **Which vehicle type has maximum number of automatic transmission ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the visualization done earlier, I can see that Limousine shows the maximum number of automatic transmission as compared with Kombi.\n",
    "\n",
    "**i)** **What is the min, max and average horse power of different vehichle type ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While analyzing min, max and average values of powerPS on different vehicle type, minimum powerPS of a car is **0** and maximum is **20000** powerPS which is not a valid value. So, we can limit the powerPS values to have better data understanding in order to avoid to inconsistent data."

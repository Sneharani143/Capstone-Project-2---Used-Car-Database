# Capstone-Project-2-Used_Cars_Database

### What is the problem you want to solve?

1. I want to predict the price of used car based on the different listed features of the car and current market price.

2. I also want to derive the top features on car which is on high demand and sold more.

### Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?

Our client is Ebay Kleinanzeigen. With difficult economic conditions, it is likely that sales of second-hand imported (reconditioned) cars and used cars will increase.It will be helpful for customers to get a correct pricing based on more features. They will get more knowledge about the new better pricing model.

### What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?

This dataset has over 370000 used cars scraped with Scrapy from Ebay-Kleinanzeigen.
We are going to use the data present in the link:- https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database

### In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

1. I will be doing exploratory data analysis, correlation and then build different models and find which fits best in the dataset.

2. I will derive the relationship between the feature score and price.

3. I will build machine learning models which will predict the price of used cars based on the features.


### What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.

My deliverables for this project will be:

1. Source code for all the above steps.

2. PPT to explain my project summaries.

3. The paper explaining my analysis results in the form of a story.

4. List of common challenges encountered during this project.

## Capstone-Project-2-Used_Cars_Database

#### Project End Goal:

1. I want to predict the price of used car based on the different listed features of the car and current market price.

2. I also want to derive the top features on car which is on high demand and sold more.

#### Client details and their need details. How this project findings can help them?

Our client is Ebay Kleinanzeigen. With difficult economic conditions, it is likely that sales of second-hand imported (reconditioned) cars and used cars will increase.It will be helpful for customers to get a correct pricing based on more features. They will get more knowledge about the new better pricing model.

#### Project Data Source
This dataset has over 370000 used cars scraped with Scrapy from Ebay-Kleinanzeigen.
We are going to use the data present in the link:- https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database
